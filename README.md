## A Wisej Widget for LeafletJS

This repository contains a Wisej widget that wraps LeafletJS (http://leafletjs.com/), a popular open-source GIS mapping control written in JavaScript. With this widget, you can use LeafletJS in Wisej like you would a Winform control, accessing its GIS events, properties, and methods with ease.

LeafletJS has a wide range of plugins to choose from, including the popular MarkerCluster plugin (http://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/). With its smooth animations and small file size, this plugin can help bring your maps to life.

I recommend using LeafletJS with OpenStreetMap as a provider to avoid some licensing restrictions and reduce costs associated with other mapping providers.

### WjLeaflet widget is based on the Google Widget.
